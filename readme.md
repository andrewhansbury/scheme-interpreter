#Pyscheme

Pyscheme is a small subset of the scheme programming language, written in Python.
It supports basic arithmetic operations (+,-,/,*,%...),
as well as comparison operators (>,<,<=,>=)

#How to Run

In a command line, navigate to the scheme-interpreter directory, then run the command 
"python3 pyscheme.py"
This will open the repl and you can proceed to enter scheme code.
For example: > (+ 5 3)
