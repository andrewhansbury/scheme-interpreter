# Pyscheme

## About
Pyscheme is a small subset of the scheme programming language, written in Python.
It supports basic arithmetic operations (+,-,/,*,%...),
as well as comparison operators (>,<,<=,>=).
Conditionals with if statements are supported as well. 
Additional functionality was added to scheme standard library, (find text filename), and (counter text filename)


## How to Run

In a command line, navigate to the scheme-interpreter directory, then run the command 
"python3 pyscheme.py"
This will open the repl and you can proceed to enter scheme code.
For example: > (+ 5 3)
